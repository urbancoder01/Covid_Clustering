# Covid_Clustering

•K-means clustering was used, and the optimal value of K was determined by comparing silhouette coefficients on various K's

•Created an Agglomerative Hierarchical clustering model (complete linkage), using the K value discovered in the earlier phase

•The optimal value of K found was 3, the Silhouette Coefficient was 0.87 and the Jaccard Similarity Score was found out to be 1
